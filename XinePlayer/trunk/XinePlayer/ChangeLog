        * If XinePlayer cannot open a movie it will tell you.
        * Can automatically resize window on movie size change.
        * Display a little notification in the video window
          when state changes (e.g. deinterlace is toggled, etc).

          deinterlace plugin.
        * Implement preferences dialogue.
        * Audio visualisation support.
