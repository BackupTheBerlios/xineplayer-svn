XinePlayer
==========

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  XinePlayer is a multimedia player for OS X based upon the xine
multimedia playback engine. It is designed to be a replacement for QuickTime
player and DVD player offering a number of features missing from these apps
such as full-sceen support, (most importantly for me :] ) being able to skip
un-skippable portions of DVDs and deinterlacing movies for better quality when
being watched on progressive-scan monitors.

  XinePlayer is at a very early stage and so there are likely to be bugs
and missing features. If there are any bugs or feature requests please file
them on the bug tracker[1] or feature request tracker[2].
