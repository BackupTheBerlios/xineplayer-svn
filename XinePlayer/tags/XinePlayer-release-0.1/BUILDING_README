In order to build this project a directory called 'xine-build' must exist in
the same directory as the top-level 'XinePlayer' directory - i.e. if this file
is /Users/foo/XinePlayer/BUILDING_README, the xine-build directory must be at
/Users/foo/xine-build.

This directory must contain a fill xine build as generated by make install. To
do this open the Terminal, change to the main xine-lib source folder and issue
the following commands:

$ ./configure --prefix=<insert the path to the xine-build directory>
$ make all install

You should then be able to build the project with XCode.
